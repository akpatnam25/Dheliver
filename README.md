CMPS183 Project


Product Summary
This web application will allow users to have food delivered from various dining halls at UCSC to their dorm or apartment for a payment. Users will simply navigate to the website and will be asked to enter their login credentials if they have an account. If not they will just create a new account. Users then will be able to select a dining hall from a dropdown menu and enter food that they want into a textbox. Then the user will need to enter their location, either at an on-campus apartment or dorm. Then another user will be able to see the request in a public list and has the option to take up the task and deliver the food.  This is product is perfect for people who are sick, busy, or just simply lazy to get food and eat.

A brief tour of the site, from the viewpoint of a typical user.

The user will see a screen where they will see a login button. They can click on the login button if they have an account and begin to choose the food they want from a dining hall. They will then be asked to give their location and the request for food will be processed. The user will then pay the delivery person a set fee.

A description of what you expect to be the greatest difficulty in the project.

The greatest difficulty will be processing the payment from users to the delivery person.
A description of the "minimum deliverable entity": what you should really plan to do at a minimum.
At a minimum we plan to have a web application where users can simply log in, choose a dining hall they want food from, and have it delivered to their room.

A description of any optional features, which you can do if you have enough time.

If we have enough time, we plan to incorporate the campus cafeterias and restaurants as well.
A description of how do you plan to divide roles or tasks among team members.
Jonathan Kung and Srinivasan Rangarajan will focus on doing the backend part of this project, such as writing code for the payment process. Aravind Patnam and Timesh Patel will focus on doing the frontend, like the user interface.
